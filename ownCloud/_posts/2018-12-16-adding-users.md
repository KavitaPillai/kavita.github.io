# Adding new users
You can create and manage users from the user management page of your ownCloud Web UI. 

**To add a new user:**

1. On the User Management page, in the ribbon enter the user's login name and password. Note that the name must contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.), and at (@) signs. 
The password is a temporary password, which the user can reset upon login. 
2. Optional. Assign the user to a group. Click the **users** drop-down and select the group that you want the user to be a part of.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Optional. Select **Send email to new user** in the control panel on the lower left sidebar. Enter the email address to notify the user about the  login information. 

After the user is added, you must authenticate the user referring to the instructions provided at [User authentication](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_auth_ftp_smb_imap.html).

For extensive information about managing user accounts and groups, see [User Management](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_configuration.html).
