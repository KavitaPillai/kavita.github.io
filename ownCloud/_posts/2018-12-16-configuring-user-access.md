# Connecting to the ownCloud server

You can leverage your existing LDAP infrastructure to control and secure access to your ownCloud server. ownCloud ships with an LDAP application which allows LDAP users (including Active Directory) to appear in your ownCloud user listings. These users will authenticate to ownCloud with their LDAP credentials, so you donâ€™t have to create separate ownCloud user accounts for them. You will manage their ownCloud group memberships, quotas, and sharing permissions just like any other ownCloud user

After you have configured LDAP, you can enable the users to access the ownCloud server using the IP address.

**To configure LDAP**

1. Enable the LDAP user and group backend app on the Apps page.
2. Navigate to the Admin page. The LDAP configuration panel is displayed.
